# ECE303 Project 1 - Port Scanner

## Husam Almanakly

This program implements a simple portscanner that accepts (optionally) a hostname 
and a port range to test on that host. If options are not given, the program checks 
for open ports on google.com, between the ports 1 and 1024 by default. 

To use the program, run the script with the following syntax: 

### ./project1.py hostname <-p portRange>
